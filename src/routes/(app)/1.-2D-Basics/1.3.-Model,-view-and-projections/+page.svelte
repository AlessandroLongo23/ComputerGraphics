    <p>The purpose of this set of exercises is to investigate the virtual camera and start drawing in 3D.</p>
    <p>We will work with various methods for setting up the virtual camera and adjust the parameters of the camera.</p> 
    <p>This requires that we define the matrices in the viewing pipeline and concatenate them into a transformation matrix.</p>
    <p>We will also make different pictures of the scene using various projection methods based on perspective projection and orthographic projection (axonometric views). We do this by drawing a cube using WebGL.</p>
